# reactjs-car-management-system
Local car management system in a React application

## Plan
- Set up react and required dependencies
    - `npx create-react-app .`
    - `node -v >> .nvmrc`
    - `npm install uuid`
    - `npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap`
- Update elements

## Disagreements with requirements
- Each car should be represented by a class rather than an object
