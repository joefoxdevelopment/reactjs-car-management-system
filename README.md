# reactjs-car-management-system
Local car management system in a React application

## Plan
- Set up react and required dependencies
    - `npx create-react-app .`
    - `node -v >> .nvmrc`
    - `npm install uuid`
    - `npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap`
- Update elements to create

## How to test
- Should be relatively simple, run the following and the server should be
running on localhost:3000
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Notes on implementation
- Each car should be represented by a class rather than an object
- Had more time been available, would've liked to look at tests and typescript,
as well as increasing the resilience in terms of input sanitisation
- I've left the default readme generated by `create-react-app` as
`README.default.md` for future reference
